### Connect the server to a webhook with ngrok

1. Run the server, see [Run the server](#run-the-server).

2. In a separate terminal, start ngrok to expose port `8080`:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

3. Copy the forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app`) from the ngrok output.

4. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook** and set:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app/webhook`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Events**: Select "Just the push event"

5. Push a commit to the repository and observe the compilation output in the server console.

---

## API Documentation (Javadoc)

Browsable API documentation is generated using the Maven Javadoc plugin. To generate or update it:

```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

The HTML documentation is output to `docs/index.html`. Open it in a browser:

```bash
open docs/index.html
```

---

## Perform unit tests

1. Build the project with **Maven**

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

2. Run the `junit` unit tests

```bash
mvn test
```
---

## Compilation and Automated Test Execution

#### Implementation

When the CI server receives a GitHub push webhook on `/webhook`, it triggers compilation of the pushed branch. After compilation the `Compiler` class runs the tests. The `Compiler` class in `se.ciserver.build` performs the following steps:

1. Creates a temporary directory
2. Clones the specific branch using `git clone --branch <branch> --single-branch <url>`
3. Checks out the exact commit SHA with `git checkout <sha>`
4. Runs `mvn clean compile` in the cloned project
5. Captures and prints the build output to the server console
5. Runs `mvn test` in the cloned project
6. Captures and prints the test output to the server console
7. Cleans up the temporary directory

The compilation result (success/failure) and test result (success/failure) is returned in the HTTP response and shown on the ngrok site.

#### Unit testing

Compilation is unit-tested in `src/test/java/MainTest.java` with the following tests:

- `compilationResultStoresSuccess()` — verifies that a successful `CompilationResult` stores `success=true` and the build output.
- `compilationResultStoresFailure()` — verifies that a failed `CompilationResult` stores `success=false` and the build output.
- `compilerHandlesCloneFailure()` — subclasses `Compiler` to override `createProcessBuilder()` with a failing command, verifying that a clone failure returns `success=false` without throwing an exception.
- `compilerReturnsSuccessWhenAllStepsPass()` — subclasses `Compiler` to override `createProcessBuilder()` with a succeeding command, verifying the full pipeline returns `success=true`.
- `compilerReturnesFailedCompilationForBadInputs` - verifies failed compilation results are returned for bad parameters.

To run the tests, see [Perform unit tests](#perform-unit-tests).

---

## Notification Implementation and Testing

Notifications are implemented by setting the status of commits using github's REST api. A post request containing the status is sent to the url of the push's last commit.

The notification implementation is tested by running a test server and sending the status post request to it instead, which checks that its contents are correct.

---

## Build List
The build list url is [http://localhost:8080/builds](http://localhost:8080/builds).

## The states of the team

By analyzing the team, based on [SEMAT standard [p.51-52]](https://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/1.2/PDF), following this instance of the project, it could be concluded that currently positioned between *"Formed"* and *"Collaborating"*. This because some of the checklist items are not met in relation to *"Formed"* but at the same time some checklist items has been fulfilled related to *"Collaborating"*. The checklist looks as follows;

| State         | Checklist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Notations

In relation to the checklist it is of importance to understand why certain checkboxes has not been checked. Regarding the *"Formed"* state *"All team members understand how to perform there work"* has been kept unchecked due to all team members not following requested formatting and standards at all times. This could be a result of both miscommunication or that some sort of permanent source of information should have been created. In addition, *"Each team member commits to working on the team as defined"* was kept unchecked partly in relation to the previous point in terms of applying the standards in practice, but could also be rooted in the amount of initiative from the team regarding expectations.

Moving on, the *"Collaborating"* state had some unchecked requirements too. Firstly, *"The team is working as one cohesive unit"* was not checked mainly due to certain lack in providing information as well as actively participating in discussions at times, meaning that some team members will not be up to date on what is going on in the repository. Secondly, *"The team members know and trust each other"* was mainly left unchecked because lack of communication regarding progress and when certain parts of the work are expected to be done. Here some deadlines might have been useful to lower stress within the team, as well as being clearer on how to communicate details of contributed work and more clearly present what aspects has been tested successfully and how that was accomplished.
